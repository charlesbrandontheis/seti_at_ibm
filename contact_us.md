Compelling models and analysis built by citizen scientists will be seriously considered
by SETI scientists and this SETI+IBM collaboration. 

We are intersted in new techiniques that will achieve [our scientific goals](science_goals.md).

Post your analysis onlne (Github Gist?) and then submit a description and link to your work to [the 
Issues page for this repository](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/seti_at_ibm/issues). 
However, when you create a new Issue, please give it the title "Analysis: <your title>" so that we
can easily differentiate between analysis posts and other types of "Issues".
